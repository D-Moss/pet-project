				Hello everyone, I would like to introduce myself, but I don't have a name at the moment. I was born in February, and I am a Miniature American Eskimo mixed with a Shetland Sheepdog. I am a gorgeous brown and white puppy with thick, fluffy fur living in a cage with my brothers and sisters on an Amish farm. Every day I play with my siblings, and someone will come around to provide us with fresh food and water. I have fun but my days are always the same. Well at least they were until one something happenedâ€¦.

						<p class="mb-5">
							As I mentioned I am a puppy living on an Amish farm with my siblings doing the same thing day in and day out. Until one day I met someone new. She came over to the cage and picked me up and cuddled me. I was a little confused because I had no idea where we were going but she kept saying that we were going home. I had a home already but of course I went along for the adventure; I didnâ€™t really have a choice; my legs are short ðŸ˜‚. Anyway, the lady who picked me up, Diona, was nice and she named me Toven. She said that I reminded her of a baby Beethoven, whoever that is. Whatever, I got food and water every day, twice a day and we went outside for walks. It wasnâ€™t just her that would take me outside, sometimes her mom would take me and other times her dad. I finally got the adventure that I was looking for. I was no longer doing the same thing every day; I was having fun.

						<h2 class="mb-5">Playful</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">
							I am a very playful dog and one thing that I like doing is stealing Dionaâ€™s bottles. Water bottles. Soda bottles. It doesnâ€™t matter. If the bottle was empty, I would take it and run. She would chase me around the house trying to get it back and sometimes I chased her just because it was fun. Sometimes she would yell out to mom for help because she needed backup, that snitch ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚. It was all fun and games and I never got in trouble. As you can see, I just wanted to be like Diona. She is my favorite and I would do anything to protect her.

							Sometimes her dad would grab her and wouldnâ€™t let her go. So I barked and growled at him until he let her go. He always let her go fairly quickly and Diona would praise me and give me treats. Peanut butter dog biscuits, chicken flavored meatballs, dog treats that tasted like cheese and bacon. One day, while Diona and I were out walking around, a dog came from across the street and tried to attack her. Of course, I stepped in and saved her and yes, she jumped in and protected me as well. Luckily, we both walked away without a scratch and once we got home, I got two bags of chips. Mom and dad were so glad that we were okay, but they knew that I wouldnâ€™t let anything happen to her and vice versa.

						<p class="mb-5">
							At Christmastime, mom gave me my very own ham bone and it still had some meat on it. Talk about a treat!!! Needless to say, winter was my favorite time of the year especially when there was snow on the ground. I remember Diona taking me out for walks, and I would chase her around the snow in the playground. She couldnâ€™t outrun me in the snow, and I tackled her plenty of times while also running around in circles. I loved rolling in the snow and sometimes eating it, but I couldnâ€™t stand going out for walks in the rain. Sometimes I refused to go, and they understood because they didnâ€™t want to walk in the rain either. When I was younger it was okay but as I got older, I just wasnâ€™t looking forward to going out on those rainy days.
