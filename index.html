			<h1>Get to know me</h1>
			<p>
				Hello everyone, I would like to introduce myself, but I don't have a name at the moment. I was born in February, and I am a Miniature American Eskimo mixed with a Shetland Sheepdog. I am a gorgeous brown and white puppy with thick fluffy fur, living in a cage with my brothers and sisters on an Amish farm. Every day I play with my siblings, and someone always come around to provide us with fresh food and water. I have fun but my days are always the same. Well, at least they were, until one day something happenedâ€¦

				<h1>Puppy Days</h1>
				<p class="dog-description1">
					As I mentioned I am a puppy living on an Amish farm with my siblings doing the same thing day in and day out. Until one day I met someone new. She came over to the cage and picked me up and cuddled me. She said that we were going home. I was a little confused because I had a home already but of course I went along for the adventure.<span id="dots">...</span> <span id="more"> I didnâ€™t really have a choice since my legs are short ðŸ˜‚. Anyway, the lady who picked me up, Diona, was nice and she named me Toven. She said that I reminded her of a baby Beethoven, whoever that is. Whatever, I got food and water every day, twice a day and we went outside for walks. It wasnâ€™t just her that would take me outside, sometimes her mom would take me and other times her dad. I finally got the adventure that I was looking for. I was no longer doing the same thing every day; I was having fun.</span>

				<h1>Having Fun</h1>
				<p class="dog-description2">
					I am no longer a puppy but a very playful dog and one thing that I like doing is stealing Dionaâ€™s bottles. Water bottles. Soda bottles. It doesnâ€™t matter. If the bottle was empty, I would take it and run. She would chase me around the house trying to get it back but I also I chased her just because it was fun. There were times where she would yell out to mom for help because she needed backup, that snitch ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚. It was all fun and games and I never got in trouble. As you can see, I just wanted to be like Diona. She is my favorite and I would do anything to protect her.

				<h1>Protector</h1>
				<p class="dog-description1">
					As I got older, I've gotten better at protecting Diona. Every now and then her dad would wrap his arms around her and not let go. So I barked and growled at him and he would release her fairly quickly. I knew he was just playing but I had a job to do. One day while Diona and I were out on one of our walks, a dog came from across the street and tried to attack her. Of course, I stepped in and saved her and yes, she jumped in and protected me as well. <span id="dot">...</span> <span id="continue">Luckily, we both walked away without a scratch. We went home mom and dad were so glad that we were okay, but they knew that I wouldnâ€™t let anything happen to her and vice versa. I got two bags of chips that day. They always gave me some of the best treats; peanut butter dog biscuits, chicken flavored meatballs, dog treats that tasted like cheese and bacon. Oh, and the food was great too. I may have had dry dog food but at times it was mixed with rice and gravy. That was so good.</span>

				<h1>Snow Days</h1>
				<p class="dog-description2">
					During Christmastime, mom would give me my very own ham bone and it still had some meat on it. Talk about a treat!!! Needless to say, winter was my favorite time of the year especially when there was snow on the ground. I remember Diona taking me out for walks, and I would chase her around in the snow at the playground. She couldnâ€™t outrun me in the snow, and I tackled her plenty of times while also running around in circles. I loved rolling in the snow and accasionally eating it, but I couldnâ€™t stand going out for walks in the rain. Sometimes I refused to go, and they understood because they didnâ€™t want to walk in the rain either. When I was younger it was okay but as I got older, I just wasnâ€™t looking forward to going out on those days.

				<h1>Adult</h1>
				<p class="dog-description1">
					Living in this house has been great. Diona and her parents, they were absolutely wonderful, and they provided me with everything that I needed and wanted. It was a very loving and joyful home. The neighbors and everyone who saw me while we were out for walks, adored me. I got a lot of compliments in my 19 years of living with them but unfortunately nothing lasts forever. I am no longer living in the house with them, but I am still living on in their hearts.<span id="period">..</span> <span id="extra">Of course, they shed a lot of tears on the day that I left and sometimes they still get a little emotional thinking of me, but the thoughts are always good. I still visit from time to time though. They may see me in their dreams, or they will say that they miss me. I have received nothing but love in my furever home and I am profoundly grateful that I went home with them that day.</span>
