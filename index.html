				Hello everyone, I would like to introduce myself, but I don't have a name at the moment. I was born in February, and I am a Miniature American Eskimo mixed with a Shetland Sheepdog. I am a brown and white puppy living in a cage with my brothers and sisters on an Amish farm. Every day I play with my siblings, and someone will come around to provide us with fresh food and water. I have fun but my days are always the same. Well at least they were until one something happenedâ€¦

						<p class="mb-5">
							As I mentioned I am a puppy living on an Amish farm with my siblings doing the same thing day in and day out. Until one day I met someone new. She came over to the cage and picked me up and cuddled me. I was a little confused because I had no idea where we were going but she kept saying that we were going home. I had a home already but of course I went along for the adventure; I didnâ€™t really have a choice; my legs are short ðŸ˜‚. Anyway, the lady who picked me up, Diona, was nice and she named me Toven. She said that I reminded her of a baby Beethoven, whoever that is. Whatever, I got food and water every day, twice a day and we went outside for walks. It wasnâ€™t just her that would take me outside, sometimes her mom would take me and other times her dad. I finally got the adventure that I was looking for. I was no longer doing the same thing every day; I was having fun.

						<h2 class="mb-5">Playful</h2>
						<p class="mb-5">
							I am a very playful dog and one thing that I like doing is stealing Dionaâ€™s bottles. Water bottles. Soda bottles. It doesnâ€™t matter. If the bottle was empty, I would take it and run. She would chase me around the house trying to get it back and sometimes I chased her just because it was fun. Sometimes she would yell out to mom for help because she needed backup, that snitch ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚ ðŸ˜‚. It was all fun and games and I never got in trouble. As you can see, I just wanted to be like Diona. She is my favorite and I would do anything to protect her.
